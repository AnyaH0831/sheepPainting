CreepySheepPainting

The original reference of this sheep is from a photo I took 2 years ago at the Exibition Place. However, the actual sheep does not look this creepy and the eyes are not red. 

I wanted to paint this sheep was because I saw the red tag on its ears numbered "21", thus, this reminds me of a book called "I Am Not a Number" by Kathy Kacer that I read a long time ago. Which is a book about how Indigenous children attend residential school, and they lost their name, but instead being called as a number. This also reminded me of various novels/stories/movies that I have read/watched, which many of them illustrates the concequences when human treats a population very poorly. They can be a specific human population, robots/AIs, animals, nature in general, or even non-living things [This would probably be very fictional/fantasy-type story]. The concequences often be their repel, hostility, and attack in response. Therefore, I planned on emphasizing the vibrant colours such as the red and yellow tag on the ears, and of course the creepy red eyes. To accomplish this, I made the cover/clothing of the sheep to be green, as it is the complementary colour of red. I also chose a very dark background, so it makes the more vibrant colours pop.
